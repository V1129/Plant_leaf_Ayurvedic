ðŸ“Œ Features

Automatic Leaf Detection â€“ Reads images and extracts key features.

Ayurvedic Plant Classification â€“ Predicts plant name and category.

Easy to Train â€“ Includes scripts for training and retraining the model.

GUI Interface â€“ Simple and user-friendly interface.

Batch Prediction â€“ Can process multiple images at once.
